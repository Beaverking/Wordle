# Wordle

Why I choose my container class:
	It has a fixed length that I know my program will never go over.
	It can only add string with the length of 5 so i know the game loop will never encouter that on word is too long.
	It has built in uppercase transformer.
	It's easy to set, add, print and get the word length.
